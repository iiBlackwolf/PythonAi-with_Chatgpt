Python AI Virtual Assistant

This repository contains code for a Python-based AI virtual assistant powered by the OpenAI GPT-3 language model. The virtual assistant can engage in conversation, respond to user queries, and provide helpful information.

Features:
- Interactive conversation: Users can have a conversation with the AI virtual assistant by exchanging messages.
- Natural language processing: The assistant uses advanced natural language processing techniques to understand and generate human-like responses.
- OpenAI integration: The code integrates with the OpenAI API to leverage the powerful text generation capabilities of the GPT-3 model.
- Conversation history: The assistant keeps track of the conversation history to provide context-aware responses.

Usage:
1. Set up OpenAI API: Obtain an API key from OpenAI and configure it in the code(Add to config.py).
2. Run the code: Execute the Python script to start the virtual assistant.
3. Engage in conversation: Enter messages in the console to interact with the virtual assistant and receive AI-generated responses.

Note: This code is built upon the OpenAI GPT-3 model and requires an active OpenAI API key for proper functionality.

Feel free to explore and extend the functionality of the virtual assistant by adding new features or integrating it into your own projects.
